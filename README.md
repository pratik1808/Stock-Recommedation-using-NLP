# Stock-Recommedation-using-NLP

As a Financial analyst working at a YO’I’O investment company it is important to understand people’s sentiments about the market along with company performance as it assists in making optimal purchase decisions.
Also it is recently becoming an important factor in deciding upon which stocks should the investment company track and ultimately decide whether one should buy a particular stock/stocks from a particular industry to maximize the profits.
Wallstreetbets on Reddit is one of the many public forums where people discuss such recent market trends and express their sentiments about them.

This project aims to gather insights from analysing data from this public forum to identify trending topics using Topic modelling and make purchase decisions using Sentiment Analysis with VADER.
